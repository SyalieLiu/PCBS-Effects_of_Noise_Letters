Replication of Effects of Noise Letters upon the Identification of A Target Letter in A Nonsearch Task, Eriksen & Eriksen (1974)

The studay aims at understanding the effect of noise on target identification but with a baseline condition : assessing the effect of noise on speed and accuracy in target identification when no visual search is required. By having a nonsearch task where a letter always appears in the same known location, researchers want to eliminate confounders variables due to the fact that search task involves, by definition, processing noise in order to identify the target. 

In a first manipulation, participants were asked to respond to only one target letter that would always appear in the same location, and ignore any all noise letters appearing next to the target. Depending on the target letter, participants were asked to press a lever either to the left or right. There were 5 noise conditions. 
In a second experiment, researchers manipulated the spacing between adjacent letters of the display. 
Reaction times of participants were recorded for both experiments.
